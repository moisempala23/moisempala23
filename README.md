Hi, My name is Moise Mpala. Most people call me (Moses). Im originally from Africa but moved to the United States at a young age.  
Currently, I'm in the Air Force Reserve as a Security Forces member and a Coach/Trainer on the civilian side. I'm currently working on finishing my IT course on CourseCareers, but I'm also studying Cyber security on the side. One thing about me is that I'm always willing to learn different things, and I will never act like I know everything because I don't think anyone does. When I'm wrong, I prioritize fixing what I did wrong, but I will also admit to my wrongdoing to get help. One reason I pursue IT/Cyber is because I've realized how much technology is advancing. The need for people to help with new technology and protect them is rising, so I want to help out in this field because I love technology and learning.
